/**
 * The Member/Admin application shell copy dictionary (Phase 5.5, UIF-035/UIF-039/UIF-041).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY SEPARATE FROM `lib/public/copy` — not a second i18n SYSTEM (still the one i18next
 * instance, wired below through `lib/i18n/config.ts`), but a second CONTENT MODULE, and for a
 * concrete, tested reason: `tests/public/dto-structure.test.ts` scans every file under
 * `lib/public/` for denylisted private-table vocabulary (`organizations`, `payouts`, `disputes`,
 * `members`, ...) as a structural boundary on the audited PUBLIC read layer. Admin module NAMES —
 * honest UI labels naming a future operational area, nothing about a specific record — legitimately
 * contain exactly those words, so they cannot live inside `lib/public/*` without permanently
 * weakening that boundary test's guarantee for the surface it actually protects. This module is
 * simply outside its scan root.
 *
 * SERVER-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION, same as `lib/public/copy`: no `"use client"`, no `react` import, no
 * `i18next` import. `getAppCopy(locale)` resolves untranslated Arabic keys to the reviewed English
 * exactly the way `lib/public/copy`'s `getCopy()` does — same honesty mechanism, same pattern,
 * different content root.
 *
 * WHAT BELONGS HERE: Member/Admin shell chrome — sidebar/topbar/drawer labels, landmark names,
 * breadcrumb copy, empty/forbidden-state copy for the two real guarded routes, and the NAMES (not
 * the content) of future operational modules the role-scalable navigation structure documents.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT: any business claim, KPI, count, or record. No module here is functionally
 * implemented (see `components/app/admin-navigation.tsx`, `member-navigation.tsx`).
